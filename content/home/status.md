Following the devastation caused by the fire in Moria refugee camp on Lesvos, we
have unfortunately had to shut down production and distribution of reusable face
masks out of Team Humanity’s Hope and Peace Center indefinitely.

We are proud of what the project was able to achieve in the days just before the
fire. After the first case of Coronavirus was found in Moria, women at the Hope
and Peace Center were able to sew 6,200 durable, reusable masks! These masks
were then distributed by Team Humanity’s volunteers in order to protect the most
vulnerable populations against the threat of further COVID spread during the
chaotic aftermath of the disaster.

With production ceased for the moment, we are mobilizing our Distribute Aid team
to assess the need for reusable masks for refugee aid groups across different
regions in Europe. Specifically, we are searching for groups with a model
similar to our own that may be able to produce reusable masks. If you know of
any groups with sewing projects and a capacity to create quality reusable masks,
do not hesitate to contact us at
