title: How much of my money supports the project directly?
---

When you donate money via donorbox on this website, your money goes directly to
Team Humanity on the ground in Greece. Every penny is used for the explicit
purpose of funding the Refugees Care project. The journey of your money is as
follows:

Team Humanity (on Lesvos, Greece), receive all the money generated from
donations. Subsequently, they use the money to ensure that the women producing
the masks are working under comfortable conditions and purchase all materials
needed to continue the production of masks. Once masks are ready to be sent off,
a small part of the donation goes towards covering shipping costs so the masks
can go where they are most needed in the US or Europe.
