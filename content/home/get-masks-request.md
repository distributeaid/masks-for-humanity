title: Requests Masks For Free
---

Please complete the form to be included in our needs assessment! If your group
or organization is eligible, our team will follow up via email when masks become
available. Allocations are made on a weekly basis. We hope that you understand
why we cannot guarantee if you will receive free masks, how many you'll receive,
and how long they will take to get to you.

There is no minimum or maximum request, though we do encourage you to ask for
1 - 3 months worth of masks. If you have funding, please consider purchasing
masks at-cost so that we may reserve our free masks for groups with no
alternatives.
