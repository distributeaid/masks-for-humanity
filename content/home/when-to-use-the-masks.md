### When to use them

> We recommend our masks for the following use cases:

- **Everyday use**  
  Walking around town, on public transit, in shops, at socially distant
  gatherings, and at work. These masks are particularly well suited for many
  essential jobs such as delivering food or attending a checkout lane at the
  grocery store.
- **For aid workers**  
  In situations with limited contact, such as socially distanced planning
  meetings, cooking/preparing supplies, and during distributions.
- **As an eco-friendly solution**  
  Our masks are cheaper and more environmentally friendly to distribute than
  single-use surgical masks. Most importantly, they meet the ongoing need for
  masks.
- **As a PPE alternative**  
  As a "best alternative" to proper PPE when absolutely necessary.

### When _not_ to use them

> We **do not** recommend our masks for the following use cases:

- **For extended periods in confined spaces**  
  For any job that puts you in close contact with strangers for over 15 minutes,
  especially if the stranger(s) may or may not be wearing a mask, or if you're
  in a confined environment which prevents social distancing. Based on what we
  know of COVID-19, this is a higher risk environment and your workplace should
  supply you with appropriate PPE.
- **For medical professionals**  
  For medical professionals, as replacements to medical-grade masks such as
  N95s.
