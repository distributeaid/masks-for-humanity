> Our masks are made with a 70mm non-woven fabric that meets certain EU and U.S.
> environmental and consumer-safety standards.

The non-woven spun-bound fabric is produced from
[polypropylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene#Clothing) and
contains a [UV stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_stabilizers).
The fabric itself passed the
[OEKO-TEX Standard 100](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/our-standards/standard-100-by-oeko-tex)
inspection for product class 1, which tests around 100 parameters to prove that
it's safe for human contact.

Passing inspection also means that the fabric meets or exceeds international
standards, including the requirements of Annex XVII of REACH in the EU (the use
of azo-dyes, nickel, etc), as well as CPSIA regulating the total content of lead
in children's articles in the USA.

You can check the fabric used for our masks by entering the label number
`11-33771` in the
[OEKO-TEX Label Check](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/label-check).
