You can easily support our work by making a donation through Donorbox by right
here: [donorbox.org/refugees-care](https://donorbox.org/refugees-care).

If you're tight on funds, you can also support our work by spreading the word
about the project. You can do so by encouraging friends and family to donate by
sharing the link to our website on social media.
