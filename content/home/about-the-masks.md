- Durable
- Washable
- Reuseable

The masks are most similar in style to hand-crafted cotton facemasks, but the
material they are made from leaves fewer gaps for particles to pass through. You
can read the facts about them at the end of this section.

## When to use them

> We recommend our masks for the following use cases:

- **Everyday use**  
  Walking around town, on public transit, in shops, at socially distant
  gatherings, and at work. These masks are particularly well suited for many
  essential jobs such as delivering food or attending a checkout lane at the
  grocery store.
- **For aid workers**  
  In situations with limited contact, such as socially distanced planning
  meetings, cooking/preparing supplies, and during distributions.
- **As an eco-friendly solution**  
  Our masks are cheaper and more environmentally friendly to distribute than
  single-use surgical masks. Most importantly, they meet the ongoing need for
  masks.
- **As a PPE alternative**  
  As a "best alternative" to proper PPE when absolutely necessary.

## When _not_ to use them

> We **do not** recommend our masks for the following use cases:

- **For extended periods in confined spaces**  
  For any job that puts you in close contact with strangers for over 15 minutes,
  especially if the stranger(s) may or may not be wearing a mask, or if you're
  in a confined environment which prevents social distancing. Based on what we
  know of COVID-19, this is a higher risk environment and your workplace should
  supply you with appropriate PPE.
- **For medical professionals**  
  For medical professionals, as replacements to medical-grade masks such as
  N95s.

## The facts

> Our masks are made with a 70mm non-woven fabric that meets certain EU and U.S.
> environmental and consumer-safety standards.

The non-woven spun-bound fabric is produced from
[polypropylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene#Clothing) and
contains a [UV stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_stabilizers).
The fabric itself passed the
[OEKO-TEX Standard 100](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/our-standards/standard-100-by-oeko-tex)
inspection for product class 1, which tests around 100 parameters to prove that
it's safe for human contact.

Passing inspection also means that the fabric meets or exceeds international
standards, including the requirements of Annex XVII of REACH in the EU (the use
of azo-dyes, nickel, etc), as well as CPSIA regulating the total content of lead
in children's articles in the USA.

You can check the fabric used for our masks by entering the label number
`11-33771` in the
[OEKO-TEX Label Check](https://www.oeko-tex.com/en/label-check).
