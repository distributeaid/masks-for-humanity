  How is environmental sustainability being considered regarding production of
  masks and the shipping of masks from Europe to the U.S.?
---

At Refugees Care we put a lot of consideration into making sure our work has the
smallest ecological footprint possible.

Our masks are washable and reusable, unlike the many single-use masks that are
being purchased around the globe. Thus, we contribute to minimizing the amount
of waste created in connection with the urgent need for PPE.

Our branded masks are being individualized with textile from discarded life
jackets found all over the island of Lesvos, which are otherwise adding to the
pollution of the environment on the island.

For the shipping of masks both in Europe and to the US, we purchase carbon
offsets through our shipping partner Flexport according to the pollution of each
shipments.
