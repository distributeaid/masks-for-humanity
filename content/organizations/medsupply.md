Med Supply Drive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that has made it their
mission to help with the personal protective equipment (PPE) crisis in response
to increasing COVID-19 cases. Hospitals are running out of equipment to protect
themselves and patients across the United States. They have over 1000+
volunteers from 44 states and are all organizing across the country to
coordinate supplies to those who need it the most.
