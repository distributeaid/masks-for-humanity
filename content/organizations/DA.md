Distribute Aid helps grassroots organizations ship humanitarian aid to where
it's needed most. Their logistics experts, open-source technology, and extensive
partnerships allow them to operate efficiently, saving aid groups valuable time
and money. They currently work with the Refugee Aid movement in Europe, and
COVID-19 response groups in Europe and the US.
